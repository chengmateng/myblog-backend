## 项目组 Computational Fracture Mechanics at Imperial College London, UK
### General Description:
Applications are invited for a PhD scholarship at Imperial College London. The project will involve the development of novel computational tools to unravel engineering challenges across disciplines. Specifically, the student will develop finite element-based methods for modelling degradation, fracture and damage of brittle and ductile materials. Often, the environment will play a fundamental role (chemo-mechanical fracture), and the work will involve modelling the multi-physics nature of material behaviour.

The student will join the Mechanics of Infrastructure Materials Lab, led by Dr Emilio Martínez-Pañeda. The group is part of the new Centre for Infrastructure Materials, created and equipped with £5.4M from EPSRC/UKCRIC. The student will benefit from world-class facilities in an ambitious and competitive environment. The PhD will be based in the Materials Section of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Besides, the project will build upon existing collaborations with leading academics in the UK and overseas.

### Requirement:
- A good Upper Second or First Class Degree (or International equivalent), in engineering, mathematics, physics, materials science, or other closely-related disciplines.
- Solid and verifiable background in Mechanics of Materials and Finite Element Analysis.
- Excellent English writing and communication skills.
- Knowledge of computational fracture mechanics methods, such as phase field fracture, cohesive zone models or the like.
